Jalshodh Prototype – Enhanced Groundwater Analysis System
📌 Overview

Jalshodh is an AI-powered groundwater detection and analysis system designed to support sustainable water management.
The prototype integrates NASA satellite APIs, enhanced rainfall processing, AI-based groundwater potential analysis, and interactive visualizations to provide actionable insights for groundwater mapping and monitoring.

This project was developed as part of a research prototype to tackle groundwater depletion challenges.

🚀 Features

🛰️ Multi-source NASA API integration (DEM, rainfall, geology, land use, lineaments).

🌧️ Enhanced rainfall distribution model for realistic seasonal trends.

🤖 AI-driven groundwater potential analysis with depth-specific scoring.

📊 Advanced visualizations: rainfall vs temperature trends, factor analysis, geological profiles, and recommendations.

🗺️ Interactive maps (Folium) with location-based analysis and groundwater potential classification.

✅ Confidence scoring with intelligent fallback mechanisms for missing data.

📋 Actionable recommendations for drilling, recharge, and slope management.

🛠️ Tech Stack
